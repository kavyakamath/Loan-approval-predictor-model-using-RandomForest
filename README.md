# Loan-approval-predictor-model-using-RandomForest
The Loan Approval Predictor with Random Forest project is dedicated to building a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict loan approval status based on applicant information. This predictive model assists financial institutions in automating the loan approval process and making informed decisions.

Objective: Develop a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm to facilitate the loan approval process for financial institutions.

Dataset: The dataset contains comprehensive information about loan applicants, including gender, marital status, education level, income, loan amount, credit history, property area, and loan approval status.

Model Training: The Random Forest algorithm is trained on a subset of the dataset to predict loan approval status. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Evaluation: The trained Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of approximately 0.78 on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen loan applications.

Prediction Accuracy: The prediction accuracy of the trained Random Forest model on new, unseen loan applications is approximately 0.95, ensuring reliable decision-making in real-world scenarios.

Visualizations: The project utilizes visualizations such as bar charts, heatmaps to analyze the dataset, evaluate model performance, and correlations.

Technologies Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
